# DiabeticRetinopathyDetector

## Overview

DiabeticRetinopathyDetector is a minor college project that combines machine learning with an Android application to diagnose diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. The app classifies the severity of diabetic retinopathy into the following categories:


- **0**: Healthy
- **1**: Mild DR
- **2**: Moderate DR
- **3**: Proliferative DR
- **4**: Severe DR
